## Database Research on SQLShare Corpus

In order to aid database research, we plan to periodically release the corpus of SQLShare queries and public datasets (for the consenting users only). If you plan on using this corpus, please cite the following works:

Virginia Armbrust, Computing in Science & Engineering, Special Issue on Science Data Management, Vol. 15, No. 2, March 2013. (invited) ([pdf](http://escience.washington.edu/sites/default/files/howe_sqlshare_cise_2013.pdf)) ([bibtex](https://uwescience.github.io/sqlshare/real_time_colab_cite.txt))
* Database-as-a-Service for Long Tail Science, Bill Howe, Garret Cole, Emad Souroush, Paraschos Koutris, Alicia Key, Nodira Khoussainova, and Leilani Battle, SSDBM 2011 (short paper)  ([pdf](http://escience.washington.edu/sites/default/files/sqlshare_ssdbm2011.pdf)) ([bibtex](http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/billhowe/bib/howe_ssdbm2011.bib))

#### How to use this corpus:

* After you unzip the file, you will find: 
    * a folder 'data'
    * one file with all the queries
    * and another with script to create [views](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190174.aspx) necessary to run the queries in the corpus.
* The 'data' folder has sub-folders for each user who provided consent to share their datasets. 
* Create [schema](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189462.aspx) & user for each sub-folder in 'data'. (With the name same as the sub-folder name).
* Each file in a user's sub-folder corresponds to a table that needs to be created in the context of that user. (The name of the table should be the same as the name of file corresponding to it)
* Create all the views (datasets) as per the definitions in the 'view_script.txt'.
* For any further information contact [Shrainik Jain](mailto:shrainik@cs.washington.edu).


### [Data Release 1](https://shrquerylogs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sqlshare_data_release1.zip)

Some of the queries might not work anymore because the users either didn't give us permissions to release the accompanying datasets or they deleted it.
